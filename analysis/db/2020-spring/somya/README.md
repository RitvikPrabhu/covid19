I was thinking about looking into risk factors for COVID-19. Maybe which ones are most talked about or looked into?
Something simple to start with might be looking at just the abstracts of a few files and seeing what risk factors they mention and then keeping track of the count.
I would like to use the risk factors that they identified on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=558).
Specifically, I would like to start with smoking, co-infections, and pregnancy.
