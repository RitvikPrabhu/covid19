I think that the following questions might also be analyzed using available dataset, starting with titles and abstracts of the articles.

-What sources, best practices or challenges are in medical care to prevent spreading
the SARS-CoV-2? (There was task in [Kaggle] as well)

-What are the changes in people's behavior during this COVID-19 pandemic period?

-What do we know about available supplies like test kits and beds?
