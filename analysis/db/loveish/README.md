Documentation:
 - This figure compares Bitcoin price time series data. The thickness of the line represents the volatility level for the past 30 days. The color of the line corresponds to the price level of crude oil at that specific data points. There is a line of best fit that continues along the entirety of the data set (including seemingly impossible data points).
 - I chose to use the values in the figure because they are very relevant right now, and I wanted to see if there was a true correlation between them. 
 - These results are indicative of the current situation of the economy. These results could show whether or not the economy is in turmoil or not.
 - The limitations to my data are the lack of points in between so I am unable to fully graph the microfluctuations of the data. I used Tableau to estimate the data that was unavailable so I had no control over the graph generated. Some factors that could affect my results could be certain missing points affecting the last 30 days of volatility amount. I would tell them that something that would definitely skew my results would be the dramatic drop in crude oil prices because Tableau refused to plot that data and instead gave it the lowest previous amount.
 - I still need to make more visualizations that are inclusive of the situation unfolding at hand. I also need to make a more updated version of the Tableau Bitcoin visual whenever I figure out the issues with crude oil pricing and the line of best fit being infinite in each direction.
